## Speakers

#### Basel Farag
at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/)
Blogs at [Gargling With RazorBlades](http://www.garglingwithrazorblades.com/)

Talk: Swift 3: Swift Harder

"In 2016, the world of iOS and Swift have seen a whirlwind of changes and rumors. From hinting Swift's eventual compatibility with Android to the introduction of robust safety systems like try, catch, and guard. Let's discuss more advanced sections of Swift and what changes we might expect come Swift 3.0 and WWDC this year."
- [Basel](https://github.com/Jxrgxn)

#### Zhigang Fang
at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)

Talk: Write an Argo from scratch

"[Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo) is a library that lets you extract models from JSON (lightweight data interchange format) or similar structures in a way that's concise, type-safe, and easy to extend. Argo represents a new way of doing things in Swift, write a new Argo from scratch can better demonstrate this approach and also the functional ideas behind it, like monad, parser combinator etc."

#### Tobias Due Munk
at [developmunk](http://developmunk.dk/)

Talk: Learning Functional Reactive Programming

"Swift has introduced quite a bit of functional programming into the world of iOS development. Get an introduction to the functional concepts available in Swift and how the reactive part of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) can be used in Swift."

#### Boris Bügling
at [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com)

Talk: Cross-platform Swift

"Swift is now not only available on all four Apple platforms, but also on Linux — and possibly soon elsewhere as well. Each platform has some peculiarities, but we want to write at least some of our code in a way that works on all of them, e.g. to share a piece of business logic between our iOS application and the server-side. This talk gives an overview on which APIs are available cross-platform and how we can effectively build components that work everywhere."

Talk: Rapid Product Development using iOS Open Source Libraries

"With the arrival of the Swift language, the iOS open source community grew exponentially. We now have a lot of people developing thousands of amazing projects to help fellow developers with different things, from Networking to Alert Views,  Localization, Images and much more. Learn how to integrate these open source libraries in your projects for a faster and better development."

at [Xero](https://www.xero.com/us/)
[Matt](http://mattf.xyz/)

Talk: Var, let, and the question mark

"Swift introduced a new kind of object type, called an optional. Optionals are one of the key elements that separate Swift from other languages. At a higher level, optionals say whether or not a property has a value and what that value equals. Start at this higher level and go lower, talk about the implementation behind the scenes of optionals, the best time to use them, and how to pair them with the other unique elements found in Swift."

# Q and A


## Q. Is there a book on design patterns for exclusively Swift development that people can recommend? My problem is that I am not interested in existing design patterns that have been re-written in Swift, I want design patterns that are made for functional programming, and truly harness the benefits of Swift. Thanks.

A. Did you check this one? (https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/) via [Tiago Martinho](https://github.com/tiagomartinho)

A. Hi Syedfa, I would recommend this book: (https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Swift-Adam-Freeman/dp/148420395X) via [Gabriel](https://github.com/gabrielPeart) You can also check this repository I contribute: (https://github.com/gabrielPeart/Design-Patterns-In-Swift) It has some interesting examples.

A. I would suggest you read SICP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) known as the "wizard book" . It is based on scheme, but the concept is what matters. It will help you understand some basics of functional programming which you can reimplement using swift. via [Ayush Goel](https://github.com/ayushgoel)


## Q. Hi, I am a new Swift developer. The deeper I get into the iOS it is becoming clear that I need to know Objective-C. How difficult is it to learn Objective-C if you only know Swift.

A. The most important thing if you are working with iOS is to know the framework API from Cocoa Touch, if you know them well working with Objective-C or Swift is easy. via [Tiago Martinho](https://github.com/tiagomartinho)

A. It'll be difficult comparatively. But just like anything else, you just keep at it. If you know other programming languages, it should be alright/straightforward. via [Basel](https://github.com/Jxrgxn)

A. (What Tiago said) + 1. I would like to add that like every other language, Objective-C is also a vast and deep language. And most of the time, for practical purposes, you are not required to go that far and deep. You learn the basics and read as much code as you can. Note: Sometimes, more knowledge makes you write code, that is indecipherable by others, so watch out for that too. Been there :( via [Ayush Goel](https://github.com/ayushgoel)
