Blogs at [Gargling With RazorBlades] (http://www.garglingwithrazorblades.com/)

Talk: Swift 3: Swift Harder

"In 2016, the world of iOS and Swift have seen a whirlwind of changes and rumors. From hinting Swift's eventual compatibility with Android to the introduction of robust safety systems like try, catch, and guard. Let's discuss more advanced sections of Swift and what changes we might expect come Swift 3.0 and WWDC this year."

#### Zhigang Fang
at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)

Talk: Write an Argo from scratch

"[Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo) is a library that lets you extract models from JSON (lightweight data interchange format) or similar structures in a way that's concise, type-safe, and easy to extend. Argo represents a new way of doing things in Swift, write a new Argo from scratch can better demonstrate this approach and also the functional ideas behind it, like monad, parser combinator etc."

Talk: Learning Functional Reactive Programming

"Swift has introduced quite a bit of functional programming into the world of iOS development. Get an introduction to the functional concepts available in Swift and how the reactive part of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) can be used in Swift."Challenges of dealing with multiple popular “non-bitcoin” clones: ethereum (ether), Bitshares (BTS), NXT, ripple (XRP), monero (XMR) and more-ShapeShift supports 40+ assets. Possible suggestions/solutions and workarounds along with advantages/disadvantages of various platforms."

- [Ayush Goel](https://github.com/ayushgoel)

#### Tanner Nelson 
at [QuTheory](http://qutheory.io/)

#### Logan Wright
at [Intrepid Pursuits]( http://www.intrepid.io/) :

Talk: The Art of Generics
"Learn about Generics, why they matter in Swift and how to use them effectively. Improve your knowledge on Generic Extensions, Protocol Extensions and Concrete Extensions and the future of how Generic Extensions can also conform. Discover the limitations of generics and how to work around them, and find out how they’re being used to shape the server side."

#### Tiago Martinho 
at [XPeppers](www.xpeppers.com)

Talk: Framework Independent Applications with Swift
"Learn how can one structure a swift app in order to decouple it from the platform (iOS, macOS, Linux). Find out through a practical example how cost effective it is to port a swift app for iOS to macOS and the benefits and costs associated with this approach."
- [Tiago Martinho](https://github.com/tiagomartinho)

#### Lucas Farah 
at [Awesome iOS](https://branded.me/lucasfarah)

Talk: Rapid Product Development using iOS Open Source Libraries
"With the arrival of the Swift language, the iOS open source community grew exponentially. We now have a lot of people developing thousands of amazing projects to help fellow developers with different things, from Networking to Alert Views,  Localization, Images and much more. Learn how to integrate these open source libraries in your projects for a faster and better development."

#### Matt Faluotico 
at [Xero](https://www.xero.com/us/)
[Matt](http://mattf.xyz/)

Talk: Var, let, and the question mark
"Swift introduced a new kind of object type, called an optional. Optionals are one of the key elements that separate Swift from other languages. At a higher level, optionals say whether or not a property has a value and what that value equals. Start at this higher level and go lower, talk about the implementation behind the scenes of optionals, the best time to use them, and how to pair them with the other unique elements found in Swift."
- [Matt Faluotico] (https://github.com/mattfxyz)

# Q and A

 presentation with concrete examples. If you're interested in Smart Contracts, for which developers are starting to be hired to develop, you should also check out Ethereum.
I would also suggest that you check out the companies that are looking for blockchain developers and see what their areas of interest here. Then look for open-source projects in those fields, and try to understand the concepts behind those. - Kobi Gurkan

A2 Best way to start off is using existing APIs available. Maybe you can try some [at our company], (https://api.coinsecure.in) . We have multiple API methods open. - Mohit, Coinsecure

A3 I think learning the basics of how blockchains work and getting practical programming experience with Bitcoin wallet, transactions, APIs etc is the first step. - Muneeb Ali
